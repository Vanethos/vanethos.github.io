            <p>Currently working at <a class="body-link" href="https://www.ianum.com/">Ianum</a> creating an Identity Provider app with lots of <strong>encryption</strong>, <strong>custom plugins</strong>, and thoughts about <strong>clean code</strong> and
                <strong>state management</strong>.</p>

            <p>The project started a couple of weeks before <a class="body-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpcjBD1XDwU">Flutter 1.0</a> was announced when <a href="https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming---streams---bloc/"
                    class="body-link">BLoC</a> was the sole king of state management and instead of using StackOverflow or Medium, we had to spend quite some time on the (awesome) <strong>documentation</strong> or going through the
                <string>unit tests</string> of each library to understand how it all worked. </p>

            <p>This is one of the reasons that drove me to start <a id="writer" class="bio header-hyperlinks writer">writing</a> Flutter technical articles - not only to <strong>learn</strong> but to <strong>make the journey easier for future developers.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio description-text writer">
            <p>Apart from <a id="developer" class="bio header-hyperlinks developer">programming</a> and <a id="game" class="bio header-hyperlinks game">game design</a>, there are two topics that I am very passionate about but never had the opportunity to
                tackle them: <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>teaching</strong>.</p>

            <p>For quite some time, I didn’t have a topic for neither of these, but then I discovered <a id="developer" class="bio header-hyperlinks developer">Flutter</a> and it all changed. Now I had an <strong>opportunity</strong> to <strong>combine</strong>                teaching and writing in a way that would <strong>help others</strong> in their programming journey.</p>

            <p>As such, I started writing <a href="https://medium.com/@solid.goncalo" class="body-link">Medium</a> articles from what I learned: <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-community/asymmetric-key-generation-in-flutter-ad2b912f3309" class="body-link">Asymmetric Key Generation</a>,
                <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-community/dependency-injection-in-flutter-with-inheritedwidget-b48ca63e823" class="body-link">Dependency Injection</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-community/mixins-and-base-classes-a-recipe-for-success-in-flutter-bc3fbb5da670"
                    class="body-link">Mixins</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-community/mixins-and-base-classes-a-recipe-for-success-in-flutter-bc3fbb5da670" class="body-link">CLI</a> (Command line interface) for Flutter.</p>

            <p>After joining <a href="https://flutterexp.com/blog" class="body-link">FlutterExp</a> as a collaborator, I also started writing <strong>small news articles</strong> about what has been happening <strong>in the world of Flutter</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio description-text flutter-portugal">
            <p>After giving my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BdAiU1" class="body-link">first talk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ABarroso" class="body-link">Filipe Barroso</a> challenged me and <a href="https://twitter.com/MiguelRuivo" class="body-link">Miguel Ruivo</a>                to join his project: Flutter Portugal.</p>

            <p>With his vision, this <strong>community</strong> provided not only <strong>talks</strong> and <strong>content</strong> to the members, but also combine the skills of all the members for one objective: <strong>making good apps for good causes</strong>.</p>

            <p>As such, <strong>Flutter Portugal</strong> helped with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomahock.fogos" class="body-link">Fogos.pt</a> application which gives <strong>real-time information</strong> about the <strong>fires</strong>                in Portugal and <a href="https://info.vost.pt/" class="body-link">Vost</a> mobile application whose objective is to complement the Fogos.pt app with a wider range of information apart from fires.</p>

            <p>Also from this project and with the help of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariana-castanheira-0b2aa6190/" class="body-link">Mariana Castanheira</a> we started <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-portugal" class="body-link">translating Flutter content to Portuguese</a>                combining my <strong>passion</strong> for <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>editing</strong>, to make <strong>Flutter available for a wider audience</strong> who might not be comfortable with the English language.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio description-text open-source">
            <p>With Flutter being so new when we started our project, we couldn’t rely entirely on the community packages to achieve our goals. Either the packages lacked features, or they were non-existent.</p>

            <p>For that reason, I started creating <a href="https://pub.dev/packages?q=email%3Asolid.goncalo%40gmail.com" class="body-link">small packages</a> for Flutter, at the same time I developed my taste for <strong>contributing to open-source packages</strong>.
                As of today, there’s rarely a package that I include in a project in which I don’t make at least one or two Pull Requests to incorporate new uses cases for it.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, with <a id="flutter-portugal" class="bio header-hyperlinks flutter-portugal">Flutter Portugal</a>, we started <strong>managing</strong> and <strong>contributing</strong> to open-source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/FogosPT/fogosmobile/"
                    class="body-link">Fogos.pt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vostpt/mobile-app/" class="body-link">VOST mobile app</a> which have proved to be a challenging but enjoyable task.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio description-text advisor">
            <p>By taking part in <strong>several projects</strong> in Android Development and Flutter Development with different technologies and functionalities such as <strong>BLE Beacons</strong>, <strong>Maps and geo-location</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>                and <strong>E-Commerce</strong> and <strong>Fitness</strong> apps and being involved in the <strong>first steps of a startup</strong>, I’ve gained some oversight in what is needed to create a <strong>tech foundation</strong> of a startup.</p>

            <p>As such, I’ve been approached by some startup companies to guide them in <strong>choosing the best approaches for their backend</strong> (using firebase or a dedicated backend, for example), <strong>estimates</strong> for the projects, feedback
                for the <strong>UI/UX</strong> and laying out a <strong>plan</strong> for the <strong>development process</strong>.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="bio description-text game">
            <p>With <strong>no programming experience</strong> and eager to make a jump into the IT world, I challenged myself: to prove that I could program, <strong>I’d release one game to the world</strong>. If I could that, I could for sure find a job
                in programming.</p>

            <p>And thus <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SardineCorp.SquaserZ" class="body-link">SquaserZ</a> was born, and with it started an almost half year-long journey to find what I loved in IT, which led me to <strong>mobile development</strong>,
                and more recently, <a id="developer" class="bio header-hyperlinks developer">Flutter</a>.</p>

            <p>One day I’ll challenge myself yet again to continue this passion. One day.</p>
